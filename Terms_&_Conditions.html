                Fee and Charges as may be imposed by BFL at its sole discretion and Merchant shall immediately pay the
                outstanding amount including such charges without any delay and demur. Failure or delay on the part of

                shall be a debt due from you to BFL and PAs and be forthwith recoverable by appropriate legal action, as
                deemed fit by BFL and PAs. Without prejudice to BFL’s rights and remedies, in the event that you do not
                make any payments to BFL and PAs by its due date or on demand as required under this Merchant GTC , BFL
